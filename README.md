## üß† Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+
- Django 4.x
- Django REST Framework
- Redis (for caching OTPs and tokens)
- JWT (for authentication tokens)

---

## ‚ö† Notes

- Don't forget to configure your `CACHES` settings for production (e.g., Redis).
- All APIs expect a `/` at the end of the URL (e.g., `/auth/register/`). Make sure `APPEND_SLASH=True` is set.
- OTP and login attempt limits are IP-based and expire after a short time.
- OTPs and registration tokens are time-limited (default: 10 minutes).
